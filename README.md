# yuki.net

This is a toy project created that aims to mimic the creation and management
of an inhuman number of (fake) terminal windows that print out text in order
to provide for the pretense of "hacking" or "cool computer powers".

This is a C# recreation of the yuki.scr screensaver created by
[Fae Hutter][yuki.scr].
